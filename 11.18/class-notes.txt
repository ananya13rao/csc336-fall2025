back-end (server)
server
    node-Javascript
    express package
        when you create an API (interface w the server) always, conceptually, doing the same thing 
            CRUD operations/endpoints (create, read, update, delete) - when creating API it has to have these abilities 
                in HTML it's post (posting data, allowing us to post data from a JSON), reading data is the GET, update is put, and delete is just delete


read/write files - can't do it on the frond end because you don't want your os changing your files on your computer
store data 
    JSON file way 
    Mongodb

deployed front-end stuff using github pages 
used render for the backend stuff

Front-end web frameworks 
React 
    Generates HTML/JS/CS
    react gives us the ability to create single-page apps (SPA)
        dynamically modify the DOM based on "state" (state is a react concept - react has "states" and says to re-render the website if it detects state changes)
    custom HTML elements (parameterable, can add parameters)
    in react, you're just creating and passing around functions. confusion is usually behind variable scope and any weird syntax 
    loops for arrays : for, for each (have a function applied to each variable in an array), while, maps (creates a new array, returns a new array), for(let a of arr)


Final proj + assignment 

server side 
-  persistent data on the server side 
- for 100% use Mongodb
- can also store data in a json file 
- contribed to have a server side for a portfolio
- to work with Mongodb you have to have secret login info 
    it's a database on someone's computer
    learn how mongodb influences client-side/static hosting and server


databases
- non relational (mongodb): 
- relational: a spreadsheet. can see the data as rows or columns. sql, 

advice
- have consistent data that communicates 
- make sure pieces are working 
- figure out how to interact with the backend 
- check the final course schedule to see what needs to be implemented for the project
